# snippets

These are the starter code snippets I am using for new projects. I find myself writing the same boilerplate over and over. Hence, I set up these to contribute to my productivity and write better code faster.

# set up

Open VSCode. Hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to open the command palette. Type `Cofigure User Snippets` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Type `CSS` to create a new json file and put the code from `html-css-starter/css.json`. Save the file with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>. Repeat the process for other snippets.

You may edit the json as needed.

In Windows, you can also take the `*.json` files and put it to the following location:

```
C:\Users\${username}\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets\
```

# usage

E.g. to emmet the `CSS` starter, type `@css` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Here are the tab triggers for each snippet:

| File      | Emmet snippet | Tab trigger |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| css.json  | CSS Starter   | `@css`      |
| html.json | HTML Starter  | `@html`     |
